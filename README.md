This is my own personal website built using **_React_** and **_TypeScript_**

It's currently a **_WORK IN PROGRESS_**, I still have lots that I'd like to add
You can visit the live version over on **_[deanlynch.xyz](https://deanlynch.xyz/)_**

I have a **_continuous integration_** set up with GitHub Actions, so whenever a new change 
is successfully pushed to the master branch, it is automatically built and deployed on my live website.
