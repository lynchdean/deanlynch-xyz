This is my own personal website built using **_React_** and **_TypeScript_**

It's always a work in progress, this is the second iteration of the page. 
I plan to add more personal interests/hobbies once I'm happy with how the second iteration looks on mobile, 
it still has a few rough edges. 

You can visit the live version over on **_[deanlynch.xyz](https://deanlynch.xyz/)_**

I have a **_continuous integration_** set up with GitHub Actions, so whenever a new change 
is successfully pushed to the master branch, it is automatically built and deployed on my live website.
