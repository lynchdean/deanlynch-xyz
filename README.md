This is my own personal website built using **_React_** and **_TypeScript_**

I'm currently doing an overhaul of the design. If you're interested, you can have a look at the **v2 branch**.

You can visit the live version over on **_[deanlynch.xyz](https://deanlynch.xyz/)_**

I have a **_continuous integration_** set up with GitHub Actions, so whenever a new change 
is successfully pushed to the master branch, it is automatically built and deployed on my live website.
